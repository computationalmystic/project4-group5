## Next steps:
First, we need to create a list of tasks, then distribute the task to each person. Second, we need to build the web server and database. We also need to design the UI interface. At the same time, we should complete the code of the class and function which we listed. In the whole processï¼Œwe also need to do the test for the things. If there are mistakes, we should fix them.
